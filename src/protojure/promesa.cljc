  ===============================

  The current code is depdendent upon the forkjoin executor for chained operations present in v3.0.0.  This ns is
  a thin layer which retains the forkjoin executor behavior, at least for now.  We may port to the caller-thread
  executor at some point, at which time we can get rid of this layer"
